# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is x-context, a CLI tool that converts AI coding tool configuration files between different formats. The tool is designed to help users migrate their configurations from one AI coding assistant to another (e.g., from Claude Code to Cursor).

## Development Commands

- **Build**: `pnpm build` - Uses tsdown to compile TypeScript and generate dist/
- **Lint & Format**: `pnpm biome check` - Runs Biome linter and formatter
- **Format**: `pnpm biome format --write` - Auto-fixes formatting issues

## Architecture

- **Package Manager**: Uses pnpm (version 10.12.3)
- **Build Tool**: tsdown for TypeScript compilation with minification and declaration files
- **Code Quality**: Biome for linting and formatting
- **Entry Point**: `src/index.ts` compiles to `dist/index.js` (CLI binary)
- **Output**: ESM format with TypeScript declarations

## Project Structure

- `src/index.ts` - Main CLI entry point (currently minimal)
- `dist/` - Compiled output (generated by build)
- `biome.json` - Biome configuration with strict linting rules
- `tsdown.config.ts` - Build configuration for TypeScript compilation

## Configuration Notes

- Uses strict TypeScript configuration with ESNext target
- Biome enforces unused imports/variables as errors
- CLI is published as `x-context` binary pointing to `dist/index.js`
